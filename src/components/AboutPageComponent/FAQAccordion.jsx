    question:
      "What are the key differences between NK cell therapy and CAR-T cell therapy?",
    answer:
      "NK (Natural Killer) cell therapy utilizes innate immune cells that can recognize and kill tumor cells without prior sensitization, while CAR-T (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T) cell therapy uses genetically engineered T cells that are specifically designed to target cancer cells expressing a particular antigen. ",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How does CAR-NK cell therapy combine the advantages of both approaches?",
    answer:
      "CAR-NK cell therapy integrates the antigen-specific targeting ability of CAR-T cells with the natural cytotoxicity and safety profile of NK cells. By engineering NK cells with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), they gain enhanced specificity and persistence in targeting cancer cells while maintaining their ability to kill through innate mechanisms",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are the latest advancements in improving CAR-NK cell therapy for solid tumors?",
    answer:
      "Recent advancements include genetic modifications to improve persistence (e.g., IL-15 secretion), strategies to overcome immunosuppressive signals (e.g., knocking down TGF-Î² signaling), and combination therapies with checkpoint inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Why is CAR-T cell therapy more effective in hematologic malignancies than in solid tumors?",
    answer:
      "CAR-T cells have shown remarkable success in treating blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma because these malignancies present well-defined target antigens (e.g., CD19, BCMA) that are easily accessible.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are the advantages of using allogeneic NK cells over autologous CAR-T cells in cancer therapy?",
    answer:
      "NK cells can be pre-manufactured and stored for immediate use, whereas CAR-T therapy requires a time-consuming patient-specific manufacturing process.",
